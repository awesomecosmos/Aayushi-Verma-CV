Copyright 2022, the author. Feel free to use my code, macros, and formatting, but if you use anything else *that's weird*.

## Acknowledgements
- **David Hogg** (NYU), whose makefile I copied.
- **Rodrigo Luger** (Flatiron), from whom I first heard the idea to put my CV on GitHub. See <a href="https://github.com/rodluger/cv">his GitHub cv</a> for a much more comprehensive implementation.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/emolter/MolterCV.git
cd MolterCV
make
open Molter_cv.pdf
```   

## Why I Use GitHub for my CV
Three reasons: (1) for a backup; (2) so the pdf version stays at the same URL every time I make changes, and my personal and academic websites can point to it; (3) to do fancy things like automatically put my h-index or GitHub stats into the CV (not yet implemented - see Rodrigo Luger's example)
